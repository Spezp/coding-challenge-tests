This is very quickly made to run tests against your coding challenges at https://coding-challenge.lighthouselabs.ca/.

Install:

```
git clone git@github.com:tendermario/coding-challenge-tests.git
cd coding-challenge-tests
npm i
```

Run tests:

```
npm test
```

Add your code to `index.js`. Add more test cases to `test/test.js`.

If you make a PR to add more test cases, don't commit your custom solutions, obviously.
